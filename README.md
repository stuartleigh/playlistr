# Playlistr - The awesome party playlist creator

This is a quick project for me to try out and play with Angular.js. Basically it's an app I wish I had when I was creating the playlist for my wedding. It will show a cumulative running total of the time for the playlist, so that you can start the party off easy, move into some dance tracks and finish the night all chilled out.

Currently uses the iTunes search API for track and track data, I was hoping it would include something like BPM of the tracks so that I could colour code things, it doesn't though. So I might investigate the Spotify api.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the playlistr repository and install the dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing

Not done, this is a quick demo project, so unless I get curious about the best way to test Angular apps this probably won't get filled out.
